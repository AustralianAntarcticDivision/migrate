# migrate
Estimate the migration rate between two areas from tagging and population data

The migrate package implementions of a catch conditioned modification of Hilborn (1990) to estimate the rates of migration between
two areas from tag releases and recaptures, catches, tag-loss, tag-induced mortality, natural mortality and the ratio of population 
size in each area.
